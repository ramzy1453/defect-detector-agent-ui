# Industrial AI Agent

For my master's thesis, We developed an AI-powered web application for industrial machine diagnosis and defect detection. Built with Next.js, it leverages advanced vision-language models to analyze images, detect anomalies, and provide real-time expert guidance for industrial quality control.

## Features

- **Prompt-based Defect Detection:**  
  Use zero-shot vision-language models to detect unseen defects by describing them in text prompts.

- **FiLo Heatmap Enhancement:**  
  Localize defects with FiLoâ€™s refined heatmaps and improve inference through preprocessed focus regions.

- **Visual Question Answering (VQA):**  
  Ask visual questions (e.g., "Is there a scratch on the metal part?") and get instant AI-driven answers.

- **Interactive Pipeline:**  
  Upload images, preprocess, overlay, and analyze them step-by-step with real-time feedback and markdown result streaming.

- **Modern UI:**  
  Responsive, animated interface using Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and motion for smooth user experience.

## Getting Started
